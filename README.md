## About this Application 

Today, we begin the first of a 4-phase build of the To Do List Manager, a web-based task manager application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup a foundational system using React hooks that we can build upon in later phases, adding databases, logins, and more advanced features.

## Dependencies

- bootstrap
- react
- react-bootstrap
- react-dom

- As a user, I would like to see my To Do List Items a few at a time so that I don’t have to wade through them all
- As a user, I would like my default view to only be “Incomplete” Items so that I can quickly determine what I have to do.
- As a user, I would like my list sorted by difficulty so that I can more easily prioritize
- As a user, I would like the option to change my default preferences with regards to how many Items I see per page, which items are filtered, and how they are sorted
